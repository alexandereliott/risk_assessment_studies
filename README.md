# Risk Assessment

My collection of files from my studies.

This will determine the risk to Mass Driver Research, Inc.

This will cover the 4 main risk assessment parameters of FAIR, and the OWASP top ten definitions.

## 4 Main Risk Assessment Parameters of FAIR

Definitions: 

* Threat capability

Threat capability is the estimated capability of the threat agent or agents.

* Contact frequency

Frequency of encountering the risk

* Probability

Likelihood of the threat causing damage

* Resistance Strength

### Other FAIR Definitions

* Threat Agent Model

People, things, *or* groups of either.

Not all threats imply malicious intent, either.

## Definitions of the OWASP Top 10

OWASP tracked the breaches and incidents of major governments and organizations. 

The compiled the top ten of the common reasons for breaches. 

They're the most statistically likely vulnerabilities to affect an infrastructure, application, or human-mediated processes.

There's a broad consensus from security experts that these are the most likely.  
You should read about them and stay up to date on them because they make important security vulnerabilities that are likely to affect *your* organization more accessible, readable, and actionable.  
If you don't read about them, you stay in the darv on the most important and common vulnerabilities, and be more easily breached as a result, losing the respect of your customers, ownership, and other important stakeholders.


* Injection - Inject unauthorized or foreign code into a piece of software to get it to do something it was not otherwise authorized to perform. 

Example I have seen: 

* Broken Authentication -  

Example I have seen: 

* Sensitive Data Exposure

Metaphor: Caught with your pants down!

* XML External Entities (XXE)

Metaphor: Foreigh saboteurs in the base!

* Security Misconfiguration

Metaphor: Electrician miswires the house (Could burn down or electrocute you)!

* Cross Site Scripting (aka XSS)

Metaphor: Alex Jones as your neighbors! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRSg6MS5xqA

* INsecure Deserialization

(Marshaling, unmarshaling? stuff like that)

Metaphor: Someone taints your package en route (received an opened pacakge from amazon!)

* Broken Access Control

Metaphor: Bank robber can pretend to be you, and get the same access to your bank account!
